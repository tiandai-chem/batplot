# Release Notes - batplot v1.3.9

**Release Date:** October 28, 2025

## Bug Fixes

### Session Loading - Hidden Axis Labels Fix
Fixed a critical bug where hidden axis labels (titles) would reappear when loading a saved `.pkl` session file.

**Issue:** When users hid axis labels using the WASD toggle commands in interactive mode (e.g., `a5` to hide left ylabel, `s5` to hide bottom xlabel, `d5` to hide right ylabel on EC panel), these hidden states were saved correctly but **not respected** when reloading the session.

**Root Cause:** In `session.py`, the label restoration code was executed **before** applying the WASD visibility state, causing all labels to be restored regardless of their saved visibility state.

**Fix:** Reorganized the session loading logic to:
1. Apply WASD state (including title visibility) **before** restoring label text
2. Conditionally restore labels only if the corresponding title visibility flag is `True`
3. Set labels to empty string `''` when title visibility flag is `False`

**Affected Components:**
- Operando panel: bottom xlabel and left ylabel restoration
- EC panel: bottom xlabel and right ylabel restoration (both time and ions modes)

**Impact:** Users can now reliably save and reload sessions with their custom axis label visibility preferences intact.

## Technical Details

**Modified Files:**
- `batplot/session.py`: Refactored `load_operando_session()` function
  - Moved WASD state application before label restoration (lines ~560-640 for operando, ~707-870 for EC)
  - Added conditional label restoration based on WASD title state
  - Removed duplicate WASD application code for EC panel

**Version Information:**
- Previous: 1.3.8
- Current: 1.3.9

## Upgrade Instructions

```bash
pip install --upgrade batplot
```

Or for development:
```bash
cd batplot_script
pip install -e .
```

## Compatibility

- Backward compatible with existing `.pkl` files from v1.3.8 and earlier
- No breaking changes to the API
- Session files created with v1.3.9 will work with v1.3.8, but hidden label states may not be respected in older versions
